- Run SVD (first 12 components) on each by-department sales data and then transform it back to the original matrix size. 
- Missing value handling
  - Weekly_Sales: replace missing value with 0. 
  - IsHoliday: search through the training data to find the IsHoliday of same date. See function: `fill_missing_holiday`

*Note*: my testing show more sophisticated imputation approach won't improve the performance.
